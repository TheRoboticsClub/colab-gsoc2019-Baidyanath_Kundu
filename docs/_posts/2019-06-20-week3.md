# Week 3: 10 June 2019 - 16 June 2019
## Discussion
- The issue [Child Automata doesn't start from initial state if
  parent state ran once](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualStates/issues/114).
    - This could be a design decision or a flaw needs to be looked into.
- The design of VisualStates could be improved by implementing a tabbed
  structure - Issue opened [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualStates/issues/120).
    - Further discussion will be held on an issue that will be opened
      on the VisualStates repository.
- The issue of [User Input Validation](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualStates/issues/96) .
    - The issue needs to be split into specific issues(by me) for
      specific inputs.
- Transition Code and Condition execution order.
- Instead of keeping a Python and a C++ radio button to change syntax 
  highlighting ask user for his language preference at the beginning of
  the new behaviour.
- An issue needs to be created (by me) for the parameter design documentation.
  It will help in taking inputs from everyone to better the design - Issue opened 
  [here](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Baidyanath_Kundu/issues/2)

## Task
- Solve the User Input Validation Issues
- Change design of parameterization as inputs are provided on the 
  [issue](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Baidyanath_Kundu/issues/2)
- Add parameters to VisualStates examples

## Progress
- Added [integer check for some input](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualStates/issues/116)
- Added [Ctrl G fix](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualStates/issues/118)
- Added parameters to kobuki obstacle avoidance
