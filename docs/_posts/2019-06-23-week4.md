#### Week 4: 17 June 2019 - 23 June 2019
##### Discussion
- The documentation will be better with a blog style appearance rather than the current one.
    - This way the documentation could be made more comprehensive 
- Design of parameterization of VisualStates
    - The parameters are going to act like local namespace variables in the the source code.
    - They are to be added from the local namespace UI
    - They are not needed to be shown while importing, later whn selective state import will be
      added they will be shown to the user as a part of the states
- Design of online importer and exporter
    - Each behaviour needs two details
        - Name
        - Description
    - A snapshot would be added that could be auto generated or created by user of the root state
    - The repo will contain folders for each behaviour where the snapshot and xml file will be stored
      and another file at the root of the repo to store a list of the behaviours.
    - The exporter will create a pull request to the repository and add required code automatically.

#### Task
- Make changes to design of parameters
- Change the documentation from a single page format to a blog type format.
