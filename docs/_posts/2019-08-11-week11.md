# Week 11: 5 August 2019 - 11 August 2019
## Discussion
- A new model named ArDrone2 will be used to develop more behaviours
    - The model can be found in [this repo.](https://github.com/vislab-tecnico-lisboa/ardrone_gazebo/tree/master/ardrone_vislab)
- Any of the prius behaviour was to be either improved or a new one was to be created.

## Task
- Create behaviours using ArDrone2 and improve or add behaviours that use prius model.

## Progress
- Improved the prius_overtake behaviour by using orientation and position based
 transitions instead of temporal transitions.

## Problems faced
- The repo supplied was very old so many errors had crept in. After solving
 almost all errors(such as it needed gazebo 7 to build and they were accessing
 std func directly with the using namespace command), I had to leave it as
 it had a dependency on an older version of a library which wasn't available. 
 So I have to create a urdf with the prebuilt plugins added to a included 
 folder.
