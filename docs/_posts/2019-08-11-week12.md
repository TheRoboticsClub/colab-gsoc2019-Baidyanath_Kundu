# Week 12: 12 August 2019 - 18 August 2019
## Discussion
- The build of ardrone_vislab failed.
- Switched to making a urdf for ardrone.
- The plugin present in JDERobot base uses ICE drivers so a new plugin is needed.

## Task
- Create a urdf for the ardrone.
- Create a plugin to replace the present ardrone plugin which doesn't use ICE.

## Progress
- Created the urdf. It currently uses the plugin which interfaces through ICE.

## Problems faced
- Never having built a gazebo plugin, building that one from scratch was a bad idea.
- To solve this issue currently I am trying to fuse two plugins
    - JDERobot base plugin for the ardrone.
    - Hector gazebo plugin for quadrotor.
