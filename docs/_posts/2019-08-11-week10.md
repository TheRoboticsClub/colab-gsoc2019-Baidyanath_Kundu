# Week 10: 29 July 2019 - 4 August 2019
## Discussion
- The video made for the demonstration required several additions and modifications:
    - It should show the addition of states, adding parameters, adding codes that use the parameters.
    - The video should highlight how defined parameters are referenced and used in the code.
    - It would be better if you do not reference your previous video. 
    - The video should fit in 2 mins.
- The [Pull Request](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Baidyanath_Kundu/pull/1) of parameterization was to be reviewed before it was merged

## Task
- Remake the [previous video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nuJuUHtd9Fs08b9c9AcmKaN3_HClEmUg) to add all required contents

## Progress
- Made the final draft of the video but wasn't able to shorten the length to 2 mins. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlO-l3zDaFU)
